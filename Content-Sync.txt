Overview
The goal is to automate the process of fetching, packaging, and syncing content between Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) instances using Query Builder queries and Curl, and to host the sync utility as an Azure Function for scalability and ease of management.

Problem Statement
Content synchronization between AEM instances (e.g., from development to staging or production) is often manual and error-prone. Automating this process can enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across environments.

Proposed Solution
Utilize AEM Query Builder: Leverage Query Builder to fetch the required content paths based on specific criteria.
Automate Package Creation: Programmatically create and build AEM packages using the fetched content.
Sync Content Using Curl: Transfer the created packages between AEM instances using Curl commands.
Host Sync Utility as Azure Function: Deploy the sync utility as an Azure Function for automated and scalable execution.
Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up Query Builder

Define Query Builder parameters in a JSON file to specify the criteria for fetching content.
Example query definition (query.json):
json
Copy code
{
  "path": "/content/my-site",
  "type": "cq:Page",
  "p.limit": "-1"
}
Execute the query using Curl:
sh
Copy code
curl -u admin:admin "http://localhost:4502/bin/querybuilder.json" --data @query.json
Step 2: Create a Package Programmatically

Write a script to fetch query results and create an AEM package.
Example Bash script (create_package.sh):
sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

AEM_URL="http://localhost:4502"
AEM_USER="admin"
AEM_PASS="admin"
PACKAGE_NAME="my-site-content"
PACKAGE_GROUP="my-site"
PACKAGE_PATH="/etc/packages/${PACKAGE_GROUP}/${PACKAGE_NAME}.zip"
QUERY_FILE="query.json"

# Fetch content paths using Query Builder
CONTENT_PATHS=$(curl -u $AEM_USER:$AEM_PASS "$AEM_URL/bin/querybuilder.json" --data @$QUERY_FILE | jq -r '.hits[].path')

# Create a package
curl -u $AEM_USER:$AEM_PASS -F packageName=$PACKAGE_NAME -F groupName=$PACKAGE_GROUP -F filter="[{\"root\":\"$CONTENT_PATHS\",\"rules\":[]}]"
  "$AEM_URL/crx/packmgr/service/.json/etc/packages/$PACKAGE_GROUP/$PACKAGE_NAME.zip?cmd=create"

# Build the package
curl -u $AEM_USER:$AEM_PASS -X POST "$AEM_URL/crx/packmgr/service/.json${PACKAGE_PATH}?cmd=build"
Step 3: Sync Content Using Curl

Download the created package:
sh
Copy code
curl -u $AEM_USER:$AEM_PASS -o $PACKAGE_NAME.zip "$AEM_URL$PACKAGE_PATH?cmd=download"
Upload the package to another AEM instance:
sh
Copy code
DEST_AEM_URL="http://another-aem-instance:4502"
DEST_AEM_USER="admin"
DEST_AEM_PASS="admin"

curl -u $DEST_AEM_USER:$DEST_AEM_PASS -F file=@"$PACKAGE_NAME.zip" -F name="$PACKAGE_NAME.zip" "$DEST_AEM_URL/crx/packmgr/service/.json?cmd=upload"
Step 4: Host Sync Utility as Azure Function

Create an Azure Function app using the Azure portal or Azure CLI.
Convert the Bash script into a Python-based Azure Function for ease of integration.
Example Azure Function (Python):
python
Copy code
import logging
import os
import requests
from azure.functions import HttpRequest, HttpResponse

def main(req: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    AEM_URL = os.getenv("AEM_URL")
    AEM_USER = os.getenv("AEM_USER")
    AEM_PASS = os.getenv("AEM_PASS")
    PACKAGE_NAME = "my-site-content"
    PACKAGE_GROUP = "my-site"
    PACKAGE_PATH = f"/etc/packages/{PACKAGE_GROUP}/{PACKAGE_NAME}.zip"
    QUERY_FILE = "query.json"

    with open(QUERY_FILE, 'r') as file:
        query_data = file.read()
    
    # Fetch content paths using Query Builder
    response = requests.post(f"{AEM_URL}/bin/querybuilder.json", auth=(AEM_USER, AEM_PASS), data=query_data)
    content_paths = [hit['path'] for hit in response.json()['hits']]
    
    # Create a package
    filter_data = [{"root": path, "rules": []} for path in content_paths]
    create_package_response = requests.post(
        f"{AEM_URL}/crx/packmgr/service/.json/etc/packages/{PACKAGE_GROUP}/{PACKAGE_NAME}.zip?cmd=create",
        auth=(AEM_USER, AEM_PASS),
        data={"packageName": PACKAGE_NAME, "groupName": PACKAGE_GROUP, "filter": filter_data}
    )

    # Build the package
    build_package_response = requests.post(
        f"{AEM_URL}/crx/packmgr/service/.json{PACKAGE_PATH}?cmd=build",
        auth=(AEM_USER, AEM_PASS)
    )

    if build_package_response.status_code == 200:
        return HttpResponse("Package created and built successfully.")
    else:
        return HttpResponse(f"Failed to build package: {build_package_response.text}", status_code=500)
Benefits
Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing human errors.
Consistency: Ensures content synchronization is consistent across different AEM instances.
Scalability: Hosting the sync utility as an Azure Function allows for scalable and on-demand execution.
Manageability: Simplifies management and execution of the sync process, reducing operational overhead.
Conclusion
By implementing this automated content sync solution using Query Builder, Curl, and Azure Functions, we can achieve a streamlined, efficient, and scalable process for managing content synchronization between AEM instances. This PoC demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach, paving the way for a full-scale implementation in production environments.
